      <title>2018 South Pole Field Season</title>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m freshly back from another field season in Antarctica. This was a quick one, with only about two weeks down at the South Pole, though with transit I was gone for just over a month. We were continuing GPS and radar surveys, logging boreholes, and checking on instruments that had overwintered. The team this year was a subset of the folks we had last year; since we were not drilling and only had a little bit of camping we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the IDDO folks or Maurice along.</description>

      <description>I attended the annual meeting of the scientists who work on the South Pole Ice Core (SPICEcore) last week, which was a great opportunity to learn about all the work that people are doing using the core. This meeting was held at the University of Washington, September 19-20, 2017, and had scientists from throughout the US in attendance.
As lead PI for the upstream South-Pole project, Michelle Koutnik gave an update on our progress to the community.</description>
