      <description>I attended the annual meeting of the scientists who work on the South Pole Ice Core (SPICEcore) last week, which was a great opportunity to learn about all the work that people are doing using the core. This meeting was held at the University of Washington, September 19-20, 2017, and had scientists from throughout the US in attendance.
As lead PI for the upstream South-Pole project, Michelle Koutnik gave an update on our progress to the community.</description>
