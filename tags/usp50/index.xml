      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m freshly back from another field season in Antarctica. This was a quick one, with only about two weeks down at the South Pole, though with transit I was gone for just over a month. We were continuing GPS and radar surveys, logging boreholes, and checking on instruments that had overwintered. The team this year was a subset of the folks we had last year; since we were not drilling and only had a little bit of camping we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the IDDO folks or Maurice along.</description>
