      <description>




&lt;p&gt;While camping and collecting radar data near the South Pole in 2017, I needed a way to visualize results in the field. Since the readily available software was Windows-only, I started developing the tools that I needed to process the data I was collecting using Python on my Mac. While in the field, I wrote all the code for the basic loading and processing steps. These scripts, which were specific to the GSSI system I was using, eventually grew to the point that they implemented most of the common steps for processing both the shallow ice-penetrating radar data, collected with commercial systems like the one I used, and deep radar data generally collected with custom systems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It became clear that there was a general need for a tool like this for the broader community of glaciologists; available processing chains were all either secret, commercial, outdated, system-specific, or some combination of those. Because much of the heavy lifting in terms of development was done, I decided to push forward with making this radar processor more broadly useful, which meant writing the tools to ingest other forms of radar data. To make this code most useful for colleagues at UW, I also moved the code to be backwards compatible with the St. Olaf Deep radar processor, StODeep, which was a mass of deprecated matlab code with outdated interface. Most importantly, I added an interface to pick layers, allowing the full chain of processing and interpretation to be executed in this program. The code is freely available on &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/dlilien/impdar&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. I also maintain documentation for the software on &lt;a href=&#34;http://impdar.readthedocs.io/en/latest&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;readthedocs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was momentum for further development, and I had assistance from other UW students in making this happen. Ben Hills, a UW graduate student, implented various migration routines in the software, and added capability for ApRES processing. Joshua Driscol, an undergraduate, worked on algorithms for automatic picking and on comparison between data processed with other chains and with the software I&amp;rsquo;ve written. He &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/talk/igs_2019/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;presented&lt;/a&gt; some data processed with this new software at the International Glaciological Society&amp;rsquo;s &lt;em&gt;Five decades of radioglaciology&lt;/em&gt; meeting. A &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1017/aog.2020.44&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;paper&lt;/a&gt; describing this software is in the special issue of the &lt;em&gt;Annals of Glaciology&lt;/em&gt; special issue on radioglaciology.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Heading to Little Dome C</title>
      <link>https://dlilien.github.io/post/be-oi/</link>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m really excited to get to be a part of the final surveys for selecting the site of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.beyondepica.eu&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;Beyond Epica Oldest Ice core&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;the-project&#34;&gt;The Project&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Beyond Epica is looking to drill an ice core containing a continuous 1.5 million year climate record, 700,000 years longer than exists presently. Such a core will hopefully let us access important scientific mysteries, like why there was transition in the frequency of glacial cycles 1 million years ago. Most of the selection of the core site has already been done&amp;ndash;the site will be near Dome C, where the current oldest core was drilled, approximately south of Australia. The target site has been named Little Dome C, and there are a few small targets which we will survey in detail to try to help with the final site selection.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;my-role&#34;&gt;My role&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are bringing new, highly sensitive ice-penetrating radars produced by the Remote Sensing Center at the University of Alabama. We will have multiple state-of-the-art systems, each with the capability to sound through 3 km of ice and resolve small layers (less than a meter) which reflect weakly. More on why we need such sensitive radars below&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The logistics of getting our 3-person, 3-nations of residence team to Dome C rather complicated, mainly since we are funded through multiple countries and taking advantage of support from both the US and the French/Italian programs. The US program is providing the logistics to Antarctica, which means that we will fly with the US Air Force from Christchurch to the main US base at McMurdo. After mandatory trainings, the US will fly us to the French/Italian station at Dome C, from where we will traverse to Little Dome C. Coming home is the reverse, but flying with the Italians down from Dome C, and plus or minus a stop at the Italian Mario Zucchelli station on the way back to catch our US flight out of McMurdo.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; style=&#34;max-width:800px&#34;&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;More distance than halfway around the world&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;why-little-dome-c&#34;&gt;Why Little Dome C&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selecting the site for an ice core balances a number of somewhat conflicting goals; sometimes we seek old records, sometimes we seek high-resolution records (meaning that each year&amp;rsquo;s snow accumulation is preserved in a thick packet). To a certain extent, these considerations oppose each other since if we have high resolution that means we have thick parcels of ice for each year while for long records we would want thin parcels to pack in more years&amp;rsquo; of information. If we just focus on the length of record, we are looking for thin annual layers, which sends us to the Antarctic Plateau, where only a little snow (equivalent of about 5 cm of ice) falls each year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next consideration is where to go relative to ice flow; we want a continuous record, layered up like a cake. Oldest ice should be at the bottom, youngest at the top, and no jumps or reversals in between. Besides this nice layering, we want to know where the ice came from. Perhaps surprisingly, there can be significant disturbances, even large overturned folds, in the ice, which would prevent easy dating of the ice core and thus hinder its use as a climate record. Ultimately, deep ice cores are used to learn about past climate, and as you can imagine it is much less useful to know things like temperature without knowing where that temperature was measured. So, we often drill long climate records at or near ridges and domes, areas where the ice moves little side-to-side. Much of the Antarctic interior fits this bill, since there are several large domes and connecting ridges where ice is flowing slowly.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; style=&#34;max-width:800px&#34;&gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;

Tan colors indicate slow ice, generally desirable for ice cores.&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_posts/be-oi/antarctica_ice_velocity.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another major consideration for ice coring is whether the ice is melting at the bed. Thick ice generally insulates the deep ice, so even in locations where the surface temperatures average around -55 C, the ice 3 km down at the bed can be melting. Basal melt is clearly not desirable for old ice; if old ice is at the bottom, then melt removes that exact record. So, counter-intuitively, given the same surface temperature and snow accumulation, the thickest locations are not expected to hold the oldest ice. We still want the ice to be pretty thick, so that it preserves enough of old ice for us to measure, but we want it to be thin enough not to melt at the bed. In the region of Dome C, models indicate that the freeze/melt transition should happen around an ice thickness of 2700-2800 m, so we want some ice that is safely thinner than that. Luckily, this exists at Little Dome C, and thus the target of drilling there.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However, since it is off the true dome, and since the dome could have moved in the past, there is some consideration of whether the stratigraphy (layering of the ice) is clean. Previous ice-penetrating radars used in the area did not see layers in the ice near the bed. It is not fully known whether these radars saw nothing because there was nothing to see (for example the ice has flowed too much and has erased all layering) or whether they simply did not have sufficient sensitivity to see the weak, closely spaced reflections coming from those depths. With our brand new instrumentation, moving relatively slowly behind a snowcat and thus allowing greater data volume per distance, we should be able to see anything that is there. Hopefully, armed with new knowledge of the stratigraphy, the committee in charge of the new ice core can confidently select a spot where there will be really old ice.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;preparations&#34;&gt;Preparations&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve spent much of the fall preparing for this upcoming season. I spent two weeks in Tuscaloosa, AL, to get familiar with the new hardware and start to understand the unique processing considerations. I also spent a week in Bremerhaven, visiting the Alfred Wegner Institute and making sure that we are set up to quickly process the results in the field. It is exciting to get to travel and work with collaborators, but it is also nice to now be back enjoying Autumn in Copenhagen.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>




&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve started a postdoc in Denmark, at the Center for Ice and Climate (now called Physics of Ice, Climate and Earth). I am really excited to be here, both for the opportunity to work in a new environment and because there is so much expertise in glaciology and ice-core science. I&amp;rsquo;m funded to work on a project called &amp;ldquo;Iceflow,&amp;rdquo; which generally aims to learn about ice flow in Northeast Greenland, taking advantage of the new ice core project there. I&amp;rsquo;m still homing in on exactly what I will do, but I&amp;rsquo;m starting to spin up some models to look at effects of anisotropy on the core (more coming on what that means soon!).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In April, I packed up all of my stuff from Seattle (mostly kayaks and skis), drove it all to my parents&amp;rsquo; basement near Chicago, and flew to Copenhagen. The drive to Chicago was kind of fun&amp;ndash;Julia joined me, and we were able to stop for a day to ski at Big Sky with some blue sky, fresh-ish April Powder, and the upper mountain completely open. We also took a slight detour down to pass through the Badlands&amp;ndash;I had been 12 years ago but Julia had never been, and she was excited about the paleosols.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Late April was a great time to show up in Denmark. The days have been long for the first few months that I have been here, leaving plenty of time to bike around the city in the light and to start get to know the place. I had a week to buy a bike, start to sort out the financial and administrative aspects of moving internationally, and fill the tiny fridge with some food.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just after I arrived, the Greenland field season began to start up as the EastGRIP (GReenland Ice-core Project) camp opened. Many of the students, staff, and faculty cycle through trips to work at the camp through the course of the summer, so the office quickly emptied out. In addition, the Danes seem to value work-life balance in a way that is totally foreign to me as an American, and the office cleared out almost entirely through most of July. It was a great, quiet summer though, and having few people around was nice for getting things spinning up here without distraction. Julia was able to visit for much of the summer, and we were able to travel on weekends.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as it was time to get back in the swing of things, preparations began to ramp up for the upcoming Antarctic season. I&amp;rsquo;ll be going to Little Dome C to do some of the final site surveying for the Beyond Epica Oldest Ice drilling. More on that to come!&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Flow history of NEGIS</title>

&lt;h1 id=&#34;the-goal&#34;&gt;The goal&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My postdoc in Copenhagen focuses on modeling of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS). The idea is to do some modeling that takes advantage of/helps interpret the new EastGRIP ice core.
NEGIS is a huge system, and a lot of research and modeling has already been done on it, so my goal is to really leverage new, unique information that we can get from having an ice core in the middle of the ice stream.
Because the ice core contains records extending back thousands of years, far longer than more direct records of ice flow, so it could give us unique information about the long-term ice flow.
The idea that I have started to run with is to use the crystal fabric of the core as a tracer of past flow.
For a primer on crystal fabric, take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/project/fabric/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;work I have doing to use fabric as a tracer of past flow.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;past-work-on-negis&#34;&gt;Past work on NEGIS&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When I was still at the University of Washington, I did some &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/publication/negis_margins/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;work&lt;/a&gt; with then-postdoc Nick Holschuh to understand the relationship between radar data collected on NEGIS and the small-scale flow regime. I ran a number of model simulations, which Nick used to aid in interpretation of the radar data and to determine how well the various simulations matched reality. The work suggests that the isochrones do not match the current flow field, but rather imply some transient changes to the ice stream. While Nick was able to obtain some nice results, they give a tantalizing suggestion of instability without allowing us to quantify it or say much about the cause. Consequently, I was extremely excited to get to come to Copenhagen to work on this system as new data are collected.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;anisotropic-modeling&#34;&gt;Anisotropic modeling&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For my current work, I&amp;rsquo;m modeling along flowlines that lead to near the EastGRIP core site.
By modeling the development of ice-crystal fabric along multiple flowlines, I can explore a range of possible flow histories (hypothetical ways in which the ice stream might have differed in the past).
If we could then associate one these flow histories with what is measured in the ice core, we might then be able to say something about ice flow in the past.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Right now, this work is in its preliminary stages. I have a working model, which took significant time due to all the processes that must be included.
One of the many challenges is that many effects must be included; for example, temperature affects how easily ice deforms (see figure below), so we may get a very different fabric if we don&amp;rsquo;t account for the large change in temperature in Greenland since the last ice age.
I&amp;rsquo;ve worked out these kinks, and am preparing to run model simulations that can more accurately represent fabric formation on these flowlines and thus be compared with ice-core data.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/temp_vel_comp.png&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Effect of temperature on a flow line&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The preliminary results were been encouraging, but the complexity of the different effects led me to take a significant step back and think about the essential aspects of fabric in an ice stream. This led a full project just understanding these effects in the abstract, which is described &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/project/fabric/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;here.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2019 South Pole field season</title>

&lt;p&gt;In December, I headed to the South Pole for a third field season, wrapping our survey of regional ice flow. Like last year, this was a very quick season with only about two weeks at the Pole. As in previous years, the field season was timed to span the solstice so as to get the warmest weather at the South Pole (~-10 F this year). We left for New Zealand week after Thanksgiving, and after getting our cold weather gear we started trying to fly to Antarctica on December 13th. At first, we were trying to fly on a &amp;ldquo;Kiwi Herc&amp;rdquo;, a C-130 belonging to the Royal New Zealand Air Force that has wheels and no skis. On the first day, we flew 5 hours before turning around due to changing weather in McMurdo and flying the 5 hours back to Christchurch; these turnaround flights are not altogether uncommon and are called &amp;ldquo;boomerangs&amp;rdquo;. The next day we got on the plane had not even started taxiing when they decided the weather was too bad and the flight was cancelled. The next day we boomeranged once again, arriving back in Christchurch at about midnight after over ten hours in the air. At that point the Kiwi Herc surrendered to the elements and went back to its sunny home. We had a day off from flying, which was a relief, then attempted the Southern Ocean crossing once more on an American LC-130 (the L means it is ski equipped and consequently has much greater flexibility in landing in Antarctica). After nervously counting down the time/guessing when we reached the point of safe return, after which we would no longer have fuel to return to New Zealand and knew we would make it to McMurdo, hope gradually started to build. Soon, we were pretty thrilled to see the Transantarctic mountains appearing out of the few windows.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;Getting to Antarctica is always exciting, but the two boomerangs made the arrival quite a relief. The view from the Willy Field skiway is truly stunning; on a clear day you can see the volcanoes on Ross Island, multiple islands sticking up from the McMurdo ice shelf, and number of ranges in the Transantarctic mountains. The views started as soon as the back of the plane opened for cargo unloading, with Mt. Erebus nicely framed out the cargo door. The volcano was topped with a very flat lenticular cloud that fully encircled the summit, almost looking like a flying saucer. Mt. Rainier often gets lenticulars as well, so the sight of a one above a volcano is not exactly foreign, but the scale of Mt. Erebus rising up 12,000 ft from sea level makes any view of it impressive. Once out of the plane, I spent the ride in to town with my face plastered to the window staring at the mountains and wishing there were penguins around.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1819/unloading.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Erebus behind the Herc&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1819/unloading.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So that crews have some time off, flights start to get sparse between Christmas and New Years. We knew we needed to be efficient to make it to Pole and avoid risking a long delay in McMurdo over the holidays. Luckily, we quickly made it through the required trainings in McMurdo, and after a few days were ready to head on to the South Pole. That flight went more smoothly, and we made it to the Pole on the 22nd and started to acclimatize.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first order of business was to remove Max&amp;rsquo;s firn compaction instruments that had spent two winters near the Pole. Firn is nominally the transition stage between snow and ice, that is to say it is just old snow that has not yet had enough other snow piled on top of it to be compressed into ice. The firn instruments all sat atop boreholes measuring the distance from themselves to the bottom of the hole. As the snow settled/the firn compacted, this distance got shorter. By installing these instruments in holes of varying depths, the compaction rate can be determined at various depths in the firn column. Our only way to know if this worked was to go out to the site 50 km from the South Pole and download the data. Max had pulled data off of the instruments last year, so we knew that they had lasted one winter without hiccup, so we were reasonably sure that they would have worked again, but we were still anxious to get out there and be sure that everything was a success. Because they had been in place for two years, there was a lot of snow on top of the instruments; normally there is about 20 cm of snow accumulation (~8 in) near the South Pole, but last year was pretty snowy and there was about 60 cm of snow accumulation (~2 ft). Combined with the snow from the year before, this put the instruments about 3 ft down.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After we drove the two hours out to the site, Max quickly dug out the controller for all the measurements and downloaded the data (Hurray! everything again looked good), and then we were free to start removing the twelve compaction instruments. However, we also had to remove the solar panels and wind turbine that had provided power to these instruments through the prior two winters, and the anchors which kept the power system from blowing over, all of which had been buried ~3 ft down two years before. With all the new snow, those anchors and the bases of the poles holding the power equipment was now around 6 ft deep. Digging these instruments out was exhausting work. Though we had hoped to get them all out in a day, it quickly became apparent that a second day would be needed. After exposing &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; of the instruments and extracting enough equipment to fill our sleds for the drive back, we called it a day. We took a one day break to do some GPS surveying and give our backs a rest, then went and finished digging out the equipment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;p&gt;The rest of out time at the South Pole was uneventful. As in previous years, we snowmobiled around measuring how much our stakes had moved and then pulling them out. At this point we already had a solid map of ice flow in the area, so the success of our previous measurements meant that most of these additional data really just reduced our already low errors. We also did a bit of ice-penetrating radar work downstream of the Pole and across the flowline 37.5 km upstream. As in previous years I was operating a 200 MHz (VHF) radar, which could see layers in the top 100 m of ice, while Twit dragged his deep (HF; 7 MHz) radar to find the ice thickness and look at deeper layers. As always, the complexity and custom-built nature of the deep radar caused a bit of extra hassle, but Twit was able to get everything working and we collected all the data we had hoped for. In what felt like no time, we were due to head back north. We had some more good flight luck and caught a plane to McMurdo on our first shot.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The most exciting part of getting back to McMurdo was the hope of seeing penguins. Penguins only show up near town when there is access to the ocean, and in the time that we had been at the pole a lot more cracks had opened in the sea ice. Our cargo had not made it on our flight with us, so there was little to do during our time in McMurdo, and looking for penguins was my main priority. This quickly paid off with a group of Adelies way out on the sea ice, far enough that a spotting scope was really needed to see them. Adelies were exciting, but I had seen some last year and I was really keen to see an emperor. Max and I decided to walk out to Hut Point, where Robert F. Scott&amp;rsquo;s Discovery Hut still sits nearly undisturbed, and peak around the corner for any penguins. As soon as we passed the hut a big black spot was visible out on the ice, and from the size we knew right away that it was an emperor. Over the next hour we watched it waddle, then increasingly belly slide, along the sea ice. It was making an occasional squawk, which was rather loud even hundreds of yards away. After it had passed us and was sliding away, we walked back to town and watched it through a spotting scope. I&amp;rsquo;m not sure what makes penguins quite so fascinating, other than how foreign they seem, but had it been closer I could have happily spent another few hours watching this one waddle along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We had made it back to McMurdo in time for Max to attempt to defend his title at the McMurdo Marathon. People pay exorbitant sums to run other races in Antarctica, so I had been feeling like it would be a shame to miss this marathon. My one previous marathon had left me somewhat incapacitated for months, so I decided to run the half. Max had come prepared with sheet metal screws for traction, so we got our shoes ready on Saturday and on Sunday morning headed on Ivan the Terrabus to get to the start of the race at the edge of the ice shelf. The half marathon was an out-and-back on the road to the Phoenix runway, while the marathon did that twice. It was a beautiful day, and on the way out I was only running in a shirt and tights; I needed a windbreaker on the way back but even that wasn&amp;rsquo;t bad. There was an aid station at 3.5 miles and at the turnaround; aid was somewhat nontraditional, and as much as I liked the idea I found it a bit early for burgers and beer. I met my goal of finishing in under two hours, though as a result of the soft surface my legs felt more tired than I thought they should. The screws had worked great though, and I did not slip much nor did I have a screw in the sole of my foot. Max led the whole race, but in the last 100 m a Kiwi who had drafted off him for 25 miles sprinted ahead. Alas. On the bright side, we got and email from Twit&amp;rsquo;s brother that Max had made the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.newshub.co.nz/home/world/2019/01/kiwi-wins-antarctic-marathon-epic.html&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;national news in New Zealand&lt;/a&gt;, though only the crazy shirtless skier made it on their Instagram.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing some work to bring the St. Olaf deep radar processor (StODeep) up into this decade. I&amp;rsquo;ve had some time twiddling my thumbs while running ice-flow models, and I&amp;rsquo;ve been doing the work of migrating StODeep as I wait for the model runs. I&amp;rsquo;m not a fan of Matlab, so I&amp;rsquo;ve migrated things to Python.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;a-bit-of-background&#34;&gt;A bit of background&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The St. Olaf Deep radar processor has a long history that I don&amp;rsquo;t fully know. I&amp;rsquo;m not at St. Olaf, and the processor can also do shallow radar, and is better described as an impulse radar processor. I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to call it ImpDAR for that reason.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&#34;full-documentation&#34;&gt;Full Documentation&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m still working on examples, but the documentation is &lt;a href=&#34;https://impdar.readthedocs.io/en/latest/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on this site&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>2018 South Pole Field Season</title>
      <link>https://dlilien.github.io/post/sp_s2/</link>

      <description>




&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m freshly back from another field season in Antarctica. This was a quick one, with only about two weeks down at the South Pole, though with transit I was gone for just over a month. We were continuing GPS and radar surveys, logging boreholes, and checking on instruments that had overwintered. The team this year was a subset of the folks we had last year; since we were not drilling and only had a little bit of camping we didn&amp;rsquo;t have the IDDO folks or Maurice along.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/erebus.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Getting of the Herc and onto Ivan&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/erebus.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The season started out smoothly, and we miraculously made it to the pole without delays, and Twit and I were able to start our surveying after just a day and a half of acclimatization. We were riding the same snow machines as last year, though Twit&amp;rsquo;s had a great custom shifter knob added. After our heavy use last year, the belt on that machine had to be replaced, and the tight, new belt prevented the Skidoo from starting in gear. Instead the season was spent with something resembling a manual transmission with no clutch, which worked great!&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/gps_sled.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;We had to haul a lot of GPS units and a lot of gas&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/gps_sled.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After a few days of surveying we brought the Conestoga (a &amp;ldquo;hard-sided structure&amp;rdquo;) to go and help put in a small camp at our field site from last year. This site, 50 km upstream of South Pole along the flowline, had all the instruments that Max had overwintered and an open borehole for the other David to use to log temperature and density. We were able to get all our equipment out there with just one trip on skidoos, so we loaded up everything onto large sleds and hauled it out the day after Christmas.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/camp_sled.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Camping gear&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/camp_sled.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/full_conestoga.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Our hard-sided structure full of soft goods&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/full_conestoga.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though we knew it was going to be as we left it, I was still pretty amazed to see our old campsite from few kilometers off, then come to it and find everything as expected. About 20 cm of snow blanketed the site, but flags, solar panels, and a wind turbine made everything easy to find. Even a little remnant of our discarded-ice-core sculptures remained, though it was wind-eroded.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/flags.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Loading up equipment after testing near Mt. Erebus, just outside McMurdo&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/flags.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Max left twelve instruments logging compaction of the snow and firn (older snow compacting to ice) over the winter, as well as a string of thermistors down another hole to measure temperature, and we did not know if they had successfully recorded through the six-month night. As it turned out, all the instruments had survived the winter despite -75 C temperatures, and so Max only had to download data, replace one instrument that had failed on installation, and then he was done. David got to logging the borehole straight away since the tools have to move slowly through the hole. In the end the neutron probe was unable to handle the temperatures, same as last year, so he had plenty of time to do the temperature log of the hole.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/it_worked.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/potentiometer.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;A quick replacement for some bad solder&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/potentiometer.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skidoo camping is not quite as luxurious as Challenger camping, since you have to do things like wait until you get there to set up your cook tent, but it was still quite comfortable. My best night&amp;rsquo;s sleep of the whole season was my one night at camp. I think this is a result of the relative humidity; the station is filled with air that was formerly really cold then heated, and so has very little moisture. On the other hand, air at that lower temperature can be close to saturation (it was about 75% relative humidity a lot of the time), so in a tent it does not feel as dry.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/tents.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;

    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/endurance.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Twit and I headed back to the Pole after just one night, and did a couple additional radar profiles to complement those we took the previous year. We took radar profiles for two days, it was back to the GPS survey. Max and David came back the day after we did, and while David logged the temperature in the SPICEcore hole, the other three of us traded off doing GPS. We managed to resurvey almost all of our stake network before running out of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We made it back to McMurdo with only a short delay, and were sent off by an incredible halo. We ended up waiting for planes in McMurdo for over a week, during which time Max won the McMurdo marathon. During the delay I saw my first penguins, and was able to work on my computer from the station. After a week I was ready to be home though, and after a brief layover in summery Christchurch came right back to Seattle.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;m giving a short seminar on python for matlab users this Friday. I plan to give a short presentation on why grad students in Earth and Space Sciences might want to switch from Matlab, followed by prepared demos where people can follow along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ll also introduce git, since I think it is probably more important for productivity than the matlab/python choice. Hopefully I&amp;rsquo;ll have a few open-source converts by the end of the week!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything I&amp;rsquo;m presenting is on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/dlilien/pybb&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;github&lt;/a&gt;. There are two sets of slides, one on &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/files/python_v_matlab.pdf&#34;&gt;Python vs. Matlab&lt;/a&gt; and one giving a whirlwind intro to &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/fildes/commandline_git.pdf&#34;&gt;git and the package managers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Workshop on social media for science communication</title>
      <link>https://dlilien.github.io/post/scicomm_twitter/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2017 18:00:00 +0000</pubDate>
      
      <guid>https://dlilien.github.io/post/scicomm_twitter/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve hesitated to commit to attending a full quarter of science communication classes, but I&amp;rsquo;ve been trying to take advantage of the half or 1-day workshops that the UW College of the Environment has been offering. This workshop was on using social media to communicate science, which means twitter just got a bunch of new accounts from UW scientists. The workshop was led by &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/WhySharksMatter&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;David Shiffman&lt;/a&gt;, who is currently at Simon Fraser University.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I learned a lot about the demographics of twitter (much older and more professional than I expected), and I was convinced that twitter can be a better platform for science-related content than other social media, particularly Facebook. So, I joined the darkside as &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GlaciologyDavid&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;@glaciologyDavid&lt;/a&gt;. We all puttered around for a while getting our bearings on the workings of twitter, posting gems like these:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Learning what this twitter thing is all about at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShiffmanWorkshop?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#ShiffmanWorkshop&lt;/a&gt; with other luddites like &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/OldAlienEarth?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;@OldAlienEarth&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; David A. Lilien (@GlaciologyDavid) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/GlaciologyDavid/status/913830554285391872?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 29, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;script async src=&#34;https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js&#34; charset=&#34;utf-8&#34;&gt;&lt;/script&gt;


&lt;p&gt;I quickly became aware of just how well developed a tool this platform has become: apparently I&amp;rsquo;ve been oblivious to links on almost every journal article and news source that allow you to produce easy, nice-looking tweets of their content in a matter of seconds. Now if I only find some followers, I can spam them with everything I read!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are in the market for scientists to follow on twitter (particularly earth scientists and fisheries scientists), here are the accounts of the other participants in the workshop:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote class=&#34;twitter-tweet&#34;&gt;&lt;p lang=&#34;en&#34; dir=&#34;ltr&#34;&gt;Some new science communicators on twitter at &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/hashtag/ShiffmanWorkshop?src=hash&amp;amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;#ShiffmanWorkshop&lt;/a&gt; , follow them! &lt;a href=&#34;https://t.co/UpKcncVA3x&#34;&gt;pic.twitter.com/UpKcncVA3x&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&amp;mdash; Dr. David Shiffman (@WhySharksMatter) &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/WhySharksMatter/status/913828644337971200?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw&#34;&gt;September 29, 2017&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>2017 SPICEcore Meeting</title>
      <link>https://dlilien.github.io/post/spicecore/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 29 Sep 2017 10:00:00 +0000</pubDate>

      <description>




&lt;p&gt;I attended the annual meeting of the scientists who work on the South Pole Ice Core (&lt;a href=&#34;http://spicecore.org/meetings/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SPICEcore&lt;/a&gt;) last week, which was a great opportunity to learn about all the work that people are doing using the core. This meeting was held at the University of Washington, September 19-20, 2017, and had scientists from throughout the US in attendance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As lead PI for the upstream South-Pole project, Michelle Koutnik gave an update on our progress to the community. After some work over the summer, it was great to see a lot of our results coming together into a cohesive story. The most exciting result so far is that the shallow radar data, in conjunction with layers dated in SPICEcore, show that the current pattern of accumulation explains ~60% of the variance in layer thickness in SPICEcore. This result seems to suggest stable flow upstream of the South Pole for the past several thousand years! Here&amp;rsquo;s a short bit on the work I&amp;rsquo;ve helped with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last field season we resurveyed GPS stakes that Twit Conway and Michelle had put out the year before. This allowed us to determine the flowline of ice into SPICEcore, and set up our camp on this flowline. We then drove a lot of radar, both shallow (200mhz antenna, to ~100m depth) and deep (to the bed).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This summer, I went through and traced layers using the GSSI Radan software. These layers are reflections off of some kind of contrast in the ice; they could come from density variations or from other conductivity variations, e.g. chemical composition changes or an ash layer. I was able to follow 13 of these layers for a full 100km upstream along the flowline.&lt;/p&gt;

      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Looking just the variations in the first layer in map view, we can see that there is significant variation, likely reflecting variable snowfall or perhaps some redistribution of snow from wind. T.J. Fudge was then able to correlate some of these layers with conductivity variations measured directly in SPICEcore and a core we drilled at the camp 50km upstream. In conjunction with the velocities we measured, we can determine where the snow at different depths in the core fell, assuming no change in flow patterns. We can then determine if the observed variation in layer thickness correlates to the current patterns in accumulation, found using the shallow radar. Stay tuned for more results on this front!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;motivation&#34;&gt;Motivation&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We do not have a lot of great observations of ice-stream flow speeds before the 1990s, when satellite observations really became available. However, the type of retreat that we think Antarctic glaciers are committed to takes place over centuries to millenia. Insight into past changes to glaciers over those timescales could give us valuable information on how such retreats take place. In particular, changes to the ice sheets at present are mostly coastal, yet we expect them to migrate inland, and thus information about inland migration of past marginal changes could be particularly valuable. However, there is little direct evidence that we would expect to be preserved from past changes. One potential place where such information might be preserved, though, is in the orientation of crystals in the ice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;crystal-fabric&#34;&gt;Crystal fabric&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Glacier ice is composed of small grains that grow in size with depth, starting at the millimeter scale at the surface and growing to centimeters or more deep in the ice sheet.
At the surface, these crystals are randomly oriented, because snow falls in random orientations.
Deeper in a glacier, deformation causes these crystals to tend to align in preferred direction, which has some interesting effects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is easiest to start by thinking of an individual ice crystal.
Each ice crystal has its water molecules bonded in a hexagonal crystal lattice&amp;ndash;this lattice is quasi-rotationally symmetric in its hexagonal plane (think of a snow flake&amp;ndash;if you rotate it by 60 degrees it looks the same).
However, the direction perpendicular to this hexagonal plane does not match this symmetry, and we term this direction the c-axis.
We can then describe an individual crystal based on its c-axis orientation.
This orientation is a result of the flow history of that crystal&amp;ndash;how it pointed when it fell as snow, how it was squashed, stretched, and rotated with ice flow.
This ice crystal fabric affects deformation by making it easier in some directions (think of a deck of cards&amp;ndash;two directions of deforming the deck are easy, one is hard).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thinking about what happens to an individual crystal is well and good, but if we want to understand how a whole glacier moves we are thinking about an enormous number of crystals, far too many for us to keep track of individually.
Instead, we think of a &amp;ldquo;crystal fabric&amp;rdquo;, some kind of aggregate of grains that we may be able to describe in relatively simple mathematical terms.
Isotropic (randomly oriented), girdle (forming a circle) and single maximum (pointing mainly in one direction) are probably the most common fabric types in ice. However, even girdles and single maxima can come in different strengths and orientations, and so can hold detailed information about deformation history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ice divides (ice flows vertically and in one horizontal dimension away from a ridge), or domes (ice flows radially outward from the dome center), are the simplest to think about since the flow fields in these areas are relatively tame. I&amp;rsquo;ll focus on divides. At divides, the surface has no slope, so there is no shear stress but only downard stress due to gravity, extensional stress away from the divide, and some containing force along the divide. At the divide, the crystal fabric gradually transitions from isotropic (randomly oriented) at the surface to a girdle, or circle in the plane of the divide, due to the extensional stresses. At depth, the ice reaches something of single maximum with crystals pointing upwards, where the vertical stresses dominate. This type of fabric has been seen in ice cores, and models can do a reasonable job reproducing it (see figure below). Just off the divide, we get complex effects as ice is moved around and stress states become more complex. This is seen, for example, in the angle of the fabric which tends to point leftward at certain depths in the right panel of the figure, or in the complex pattern of the shear strain in the left panel. Fabrics are not entirely intuitive, and assessing what fabrics are likely to result from complex deformation regimes is perhaps best done with an ice-flow model.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/idealized_init_zoom.png&#34; alt=&#34;Anisotropic modeling at an ice divide.&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Anisotropic modeling at an ice divide.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So how can all this information be used to infer past ice flow? It takes a relatively long time to reorient the ice crystals (thousands of years or more), so if modern ice-crystal fabric does not match modern ice flow, we may have evidence of past changes. Moreover, if we can use an ice-flow model to match different changes to flow with different fabrics, we may be able to identify what changes could cause such a mismatch between fabric and flow. I have been working to model how changes to ice streams will be manifest in the crystal fabric, and thus what we might look for in terms of inferring past changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&#34;modeling&#34;&gt;Modeling&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In an ice flow model, we seek to approximate how fabric evolves in response to the deformation of ice, and how it affects the deformation of the glacier.
Modeling ice-crystal fabric is a fairly difficult exercise: the fabric evolves in multiple dimensions, it get moves around by ice flow, and the description we use is continuous despite the fabric itself being discrete.
To take out some of the complexity, I&amp;rsquo;m modeling along flowtubes rather than fully in three dimensions.
The model is implemented in Elmer/Ice, an open-source software package that is one of the only codes capable of handling the coupled evolution of ice flow and fabric.
Using the model, we can get a sense of what fabrics result from ice streams, shown here for a few different ways of having the ice converge together to form a stream.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/idealized_convergence.png&#34; alt=&#34;Anisotropic modeling of ice streams. Details are not critical here, but these fabrics are readily distinguished from non-streaming flow.&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Anisotropic modeling of ice streams. Details are not critical here, but these fabrics are readily distinguished from non-streaming flow.&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Skipping over the details of all the simulations I have run, it is important to ask whether we could observe these differences. Ice cores allow quite detailed measurement of fabric, so it is almost given that they could resolve these fabrics. However, it would be particularly exciting if we could observe the fabrics without drilling. One potential tool for this is pRES or ApRES, a type of phase sensitive radar. By rotating the radar around, we can identify some integrated information about the fabric. I have used the output of the ice-flow model to generate synthetic radargrams, which tell us what to expect when observing such fabrics with pRES in the field. As seen in the figure below, these are quite complicated, but easily distinguished from pure internal deformation (on the left). This is quite encouraging, and suggest that it should be possible to identify changes to past ice-stream flow by observing the fabric from the surface.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Retreat of Smith Glacier, Antarctica</title>
      <link>https://dlilien.github.io/project/cd_proj/</link>

      <description>




&lt;p&gt;Crosson and Dotson are two of the most rapidly changing ice shelves in West Antarctica. Ice shelves are floating extensions of land-based glaciers, and are important for the flow of those glaciers upstream because they can provide resistive stresses at the grounding zone (the area where the ice goes afloat). Because of the cold air temperature there is little surface melt in Antarctica, so the vast majority of ice reaches the ocean and either melts at the underside of ice shelves or calves off as icebergs. Ice shelves are therefore critical as both a stabilizing force and as the conduit for the reservoir of ice in Antarctica to reach the ocean.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/overview_smith.png&#34; alt=&#34;Location of Crosson and Dotson in West Antarctica&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/overview_smith.png&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Location of Crosson and Dotson in West Antarctica&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first chapter of my thesis investigated the stability of Crosson and Dotson ice shelves during the satellite record (1996-2015). Previous work has shown a 35 km retreat of the grounding line (Figure 2), the largest known present-day grounding-line retreat. These two ice shelves move at very different speeds; Crosson is fast (up to ~1500 m/yr) while Dotson is slow (around 300 m/yr). Additionally, Crosson sped up through the satellite record while Dotson did not. I&amp;rsquo;m interested in the reasons behind the different speed changes and grounding-line position changes that have been observed. This mostly observational work was published in &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/publication/cd_obs_inv/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Cryosphere&lt;/a&gt; in 2018.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/over_vel.png&#34; alt=&#34;Ice speeds in 2010 (from Ian Joughin) and grounding line positions (from Scheuchl et. al. 2016)&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/over_vel.png&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Ice speeds in 2010 (from Ian Joughin) and grounding line positions (from Scheuchl et. al. 2016)&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A central conclusion of the work is that although Dotson is sluggish, high melt rates near its grounding line imply that it has been out of balance since at least 1996. Using relict surface features of the shelf, we argue that this imbalance began much earlier, likely prior to to 1974.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The second portion of this project used a numerical model to try to understand how much melt, or how much grounding-line retreat or weakening of the ice shelves, was required to cause the observed changes. This work is currently in review at &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/publication/cd_prog/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;The Cryosphere Discussions&lt;/a&gt;. I ran a suite of numerical model simulations, initialized to match the state of these glaciers in 1996, then simulated their evolution during the last 20 years using various melt forcings. The model results indicate that high melt rates were needed to cause the retreat, and that rates needed to be strong near the grounding line for significant retreat to ensue. This conclusion remained regardless of whether the ice shelves weakened; weak shelves hastened retreat, but appeared unable to precipitate it.&lt;/p&gt;



&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/gl.png&#34; alt=&#34;Simulations of grounding-line retreat during the time period with observations&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/gl.png&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Simulations of grounding-line retreat during the time period with observations&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After comparing the results of these model simulations to satellite data, I ran a subset of the simulations forward in time to 2100. While these simulations are not predictions in the sense that the ocean forcing is not tied directly to likely scenarios, they are realistic estimates of likely retreat in that they maintain reasonable melt rates (around modern) for the duration of the simulations. The simulations that match the present-day retreat continue to retreat into the future, and suggest that a significant portion of the ice in these catchments will be lost by 2100. Such extensive retreat has the potential to hasten the destabilization of Thwaites glacier, Smith&amp;rsquo;s larger neighbor.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>South Pole Geophysics</title>

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve had the great opportunity to join in a collaborative research project, spearheaded by Michelle Koutnik, studying ice flow near South Pole. An overall summary of the project is &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.michelle-koutnik.com/south-pole-survey/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;on Michelle&amp;rsquo;s website&lt;/a&gt;, so here I&amp;rsquo;ll just summarize the portions with which I&amp;rsquo;m involved.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The South Pole Ice Core (&lt;a href=&#34;http://spicecore.org/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;SPICEcore&lt;/a&gt;) was drilled during 2014-2016 by scientists working around the US, recovering ice from about 1 km from the geographic south pole. There are a lot of benefits to drilling at this site, but one complication is that South Pole is not on an ice divide. The ice at South Pole moves about 10 m/yr; one fun consequence is that South Pole Station and surrounding surface is moving relative to the Pole, so each year on New Years the marker for the Pole gets replaced by a new one, made by the overwintering crew, placed at the new location of the Pole.&lt;/p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The motion of the ice means that the composition of gas, impurities, and water isotopes in SPICEcore is affected by the composition of those components upstream at the time the ice originated as snow. This is both a blessing and a curse; it creates ambiguity in the cause of variations recorded in the core, since some changes in isotopes or temperature may be caused by spatial rather than temporal variation. However, an ice core drilled in stationary ice contains information about only one point in horizontal space, whereas SPICEcore recors information along a line. My involvement is mostly driving a snowmachine around.&lt;/p&gt;

          &lt;p&gt;The flowline into SPICEcore&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central aim of this project is to characterize ice flow upstream of the site of SPICEcore in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions. In the vertical, this means understanding firn (old snow) compaction, while in the horizontal this means determining where the ice is coming from and how long it took to get to the core site. I&amp;rsquo;ve mainly been involved with the horizontal portion, though I&amp;rsquo;ve also done two seasons of shallow radar profiling to look at horizontal variability of layers in the firn.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To determine the flowline, and how long the ice takes to flow along that flowline, we used a network of GPS stakes. These days, when we want to find out how ice is moving we use satellite observations (InSAR or optical feature tracking), but the orbits of satellites generally do not go over the poles, so we are unable to use satellite velocities in this region. While GPS also uses satellites, the satellites do not need to be directly overhead, and GPS receivers near South Pole can still see at least twelve satellites and thus obtain an accurate position. By putting out stakes and measuring their displacement over the course of 1-2 years using GPS, we figured out the velocity in the region upstream of South Pole (Figure 2). Using this velocity, it is straightforward to determine the flowline into SPICEcore. My role in this GPS work has mainly been a lot of snowmachining out to place and measure the position of these stakes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;

    &lt;/div&gt;

      &lt;figcaption&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;The flowline into SPICEcore&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My other main involvement with the project has been with the spatial variation of accumulation (i.e. snowfall). About 20 cm of snow fall each year at South Pole, which compacts into about 9 cm of ice, but the amount of accumulation varies horizontally, probably based on weather patterns and surface topography (imagine snow blowing off hilltops into valleys). In order to figure out how much accumulation takes place at different places upstream of South Pole, we used a ground penetrating radar. This is just a commercial system, usually used by geologists to see through a few meters of soil or rock. However, the frequency travels farther in ice and snow than rock, especially in cold, dry snow, so we can see layers (likely caused by density variations) down to 100 m near South Pole. By dragging this radar around behind a snowmachine, I traced layers to determine how accumulation varies along the lines we profiled (Figure 3).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;

&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/radar.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;The shallow radar setup&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/pole_1718/radar.jpg&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;


&lt;div class=&#34;box&#34; &gt;
  &lt;figure  itemprop=&#34;associatedMedia&#34; itemscope itemtype=&#34;http://schema.org/ImageObject&#34;&gt;
    &lt;div class=&#34;img&#34;&gt;
      &lt;img itemprop=&#34;thumbnail&#34; src=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/layers.png&#34; alt=&#34;Tracing layers in a profile for 100 km upstream from SPICEcore&#34;/&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/img/for_proj/layers.png&#34; itemprop=&#34;contentUrl&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;
      &lt;figcaption&gt;
          &lt;p&gt;Tracing layers in a profile for 100 km upstream from SPICEcore&lt;/p&gt;
      &lt;/figcaption&gt;
  &lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By comparing the accumulation along the flowline upstream of SPICEcore to the layer thicknesses in SPICEcore, we were able to determine that the flow direction and the pattern of accumulation have been approximately unchanged over the last 10,000 years. During that time, ice flow speeds increased by around 15%. This speedup is not surprising given what we know about the ice thickness history. Ice has gotten thicker in the Antarctic interior since the last glacial because warmer air is able to transport more moisture and thus cause more snow, and ice near the Antarctic margin has thinned due to the warmer temperatures resulting in more melt (mostly from warm water contacting ice shelves). These results were &lt;a href=&#34;https://dlilien.github.io/publication/holocene_ice_flow/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;published in Geophysical Research Letters in 2018&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flow of ice upstream also has implications for interpreting the ice core. T.J. Fudge is leading a paper on these effects, and that will be coming out soon (likely 2019).&lt;/p&gt;
