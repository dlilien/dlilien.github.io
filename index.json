However, the complexity of crystal-fabric evolution, and the lack of model results with which to compare data, limits the usefulness of fabric measurements, particularly measurements from geophysical methods. Here, we use an ice-flow model to identify characteristic fabrics associated with ice-stream onset, with the goal of aiding interpretation of fabric measurements. Using time-dependent model simulations, we identify how crystal fabric that may be used to diagnose instability in an ice stream's speed or lateral position. Consistent with previous work, we find that fabric within an ice stream is generally a vertical girdle, though horizontal shear can lead to a horizontal single maximum. Transient simulations demonstrate that effects from changes in flow may be recorded in the crystal fabric for thousands of years after an ice stream activates and more than ten thousand years after an ice stream stagnates. Both transient and steady effects on fabric are sufficiently large as to be measurable in ice cores or with polarized radar, suggesting that in certain scenarios fabric could be used to identify past flow changes. These results could be applied to design radar surveys in areas where ice streams are known to deactivate, such as the Siple Coast in Antarctica, or where they may migrate laterally or widen, such as in Northeast Greenland.","tags":["anisotropy"],"title":"Modeling ice-crystal fabric as a proxy for ice-stream stability","type":"talk"},{"authors":["David A.

The European Beyond EPICA consortium has selected Little Dome C, an area ~35 km south-east of Concordia Station, to attempt to recover such a record. Here, we present the results of the final ice-penetrating radar survey used to refine the exact drill site. These data were acquired during the 2019–2020 Austral summer using a new, multi-channel high-resolution VHF radar operating in the frequency range of 170–230 MHz. This new instrument is able to detect reflections in the near-basal region, where previous surveys were unable to trace continuous horizons. The radar stratigraphy is used to transfer the timescale of the EPICA Dome C ice core (EDC) to the area of Little Dome C, using radar isochrones dating back past 600 ka. We use these data to derive the expected depth–age relationship through the ice column at the now-chosen drill site, termed BELDC. These new data indicate that the ice at BELDC is considerably older than that at EDC at the same depth, and that there is about 375 m of ice older than 600 ka at BELDC. Stratigraphy is well preserved to 2565 m, below which there is a basal unit with unknown properties. A simple ice flow model tuned to the isochrones suggests ages likely reach 1.5 Ma near 2525 m, ~40 m above the basal unit and ~240 m above the bed, with sufficient resolution (14±1 ka m−1) to resolve 41 ka glacial cycles.","tags":null,"title":"Brief Communication: New radar constraints support presence of ice older than 1.5 Ma at Little Dome C","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David A.

Here, we present ImpDAR, an open-source, cross-platform, impulse radar processor and interpreter, written primarily in Python. While processing techniques are well established, the utility of this software is its collection of established tools, into a single, open-source framework. ImpDAR aims to provide a versatile standard that is accessible to radar-processing novices and useful to radar specialists. It can read data from common commercial ground-penetrating radars (GPRs) and some custom-built RES systems. It performs all the standard processing steps, including bandpass and horizontal filtering, time correction for antenna spacing, geolocation, and migration. After processing data, ImpDAR’s interpreter enables several plotting functions, digitization of reflecting horizons, calculation of reflector strength, and export of interpreted layers.

Since the readily available software was Windows-only, I started developing the tools that I needed to process the data I was collecting using Python on my Mac. While in the field, I wrote all the code for the basic loading and processing steps. These scripts, which were specific to the GSSI system I was using, eventually grew to the point that they implemented most of the common steps for processing both the shallow ice-penetrating radar data, collected with commercial systems like the one I used, and deep radar data generally collected with custom systems.\nIt became clear that there was a general need for a tool like this for the broader community of glaciologists; available processing chains were all either secret, commercial, outdated, system-specific, or some combination of those. Because much of the heavy lifting in terms of development was done, I decided to push forward with making this radar processor more broadly useful, which meant writing the tools to ingest other forms of radar data. To make this code most useful for colleagues at UW, I also moved the code to be backwards compatible with the St. Olaf Deep radar processor, StODeep, which was a mass of deprecated matlab code with outdated interface. Most importantly, I added an interface to pick layers, allowing the full chain of processing and interpretation to be executed in this program. The code is freely available on github. I also maintain documentation for the software on readthedocs\nThere was momentum for further development, and I had assistance from other UW students in making this happen. Ben Hills, a UW graduate student, implented various migration routines in the software, and added capability for ApRES processing. Joshua Driscol, an undergraduate, worked on algorithms for automatic picking and on comparison between data processed with other chains and with the software I\u0026rsquo;ve written. He presented some data processed with this new software at the International Glaciological Society\u0026rsquo;s Five decades of radioglaciology meeting.

If the climate is different upstream, the climate history recovered from the core will be a combination of the upstream conditions advected to the core site and temporal changes. Here, we evaluate the impact of ice advection on two fundamental records from SPICEcore: accumulation rate and water isotopes. We determined past locations of ice deposition based on GPS measurements of the modern velocity field spanning 100 km upstream, where ice of ∼20 ka age would likely have originated. Beyond 100 km, there are no velocity measurements, but ice likely originates from Titan Dome, an additional 90 km distant. Shallow radar measurements extending 100 km upstream from the core site reveal large (∼20 %) variations in accumulation but no significant trend. Water isotope ratios, measured at 12.5 km intervals for the first 100 km of the flowline, show a decrease with elevation of −0.008 ‰ m−1 for δ18O. Advection adds approximately 1 ‰ for δ18O to the Last Glacial Maximum (LGM)-to-modern change. We also use an existing ensemble of continental ice-sheet model runs to assess the ice-sheet elevation change through time. The magnitude of elevation change is likely small and the sign uncertain. Assuming a lapse rate of 10 ∘C km−1 of elevation, the inference of LGM-to-modern temperature change is ∼1.4 ∘C smaller than if the flow from upstream is not considered.","tags":["south pole","antarctic"],"title":"Advection and non-climate impacts on the South Pole Ice Core","type":"publication"},{"authors":["David A.

Difficult access and short observational records hinder precise attribution of modern ice-stream retreat, let alone confident prediction of future change. Here, I will present ways in which ice-flow models can be used to understand modern changes, better constrain the extent of past ice-flow reorganization, and ultimately place bounds on likely future behavior. In the first part of the talk, I will show models of Smith Glacier, a rapidly changing ice stream in a likely destabilized portion of West Antarctica. The modeling indicates that the glacier was in a state of precarious stability in the 1990s, and that subsequent retreat and speedup are likely a result of increased sub-ice-shelf melt. The model simulations that match remote sensing data suggest that further retreat is likely, perhaps affecting the broader stability of West Antarctica. In the second portion, I will discuss modeling designed to understand changes on timescales longer than the remote sensing record. I will show simple modeling that links ice-penetrating radar and ice-core data near the South Pole to demonstrate that ice-flow history can be usefully preserved in stratigraphy. I will finish with two examples comparing radar and ice-core data to more complex ice-flow models to understand the stability of the interior of Northeast Greenland. This kind of model-data inter-comparison will become increasingly relevant as we continue to acquire more data across the ice sheets.","tags":["antarctica"],"title":"Using ice-flow models to understand and contextualize modern ice-stream retreat","type":"talk"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                             I\u0026rsquo;m really excited to get to be a part of the final surveys for selecting the site of the Beyond Epica Oldest Ice core.\nThe Project Beyond Epica is looking to drill an ice core containing a continuous 1.5 million year climate record, 700,000 years longer than exists presently. Such a core will hopefully let us access important scientific mysteries, like why there was transition in the frequency of glacial cycles 1 million years ago. Most of the selection of the core site has already been done\u0026ndash;the site will be near Dome C, where the current oldest core was drilled, approximately south of Australia. The target site has been named Little Dome C, and there are a few small targets which we will survey in detail to try to help with the final site selection.\nMy role We are bringing new, highly sensitive ice-penetrating radars produced by the Remote Sensing Center at the University of Alabama. We will have multiple state-of-the-art systems, each with the capability to sound through 3 km of ice and resolve small layers (less than a meter) which reflect weakly. More on why we need such sensitive radars below\u0026hellip;\nThe logistics of getting our 3-person, 3-nations of residence team to Dome C rather complicated, mainly since we are funded through multiple countries and taking advantage of support from both the US and the French/Italian programs. The US program is providing the logistics to Antarctica, which means that we will fly with the US Air Force from Christchurch to the main US base at McMurdo. After mandatory trainings, the US will fly us to the French/Italian station at Dome C, from where we will traverse to Little Dome C. Coming home is the reverse, but flying with the Italians down from Dome C, and plus or minus a stop at the Italian Mario Zucchelli station on the way back to catch our US flight out of McMurdo.\n   More distance than halfway around the world\n   Why Little Dome C Selecting the site for an ice core balances a number of somewhat conflicting goals; sometimes we seek old records, sometimes we seek high-resolution records (meaning that each year\u0026rsquo;s snow accumulation is preserved in a thick packet). To a certain extent, these considerations oppose each other since if we have high resolution that means we have thick parcels of ice for each year while for long records we would want thin parcels to pack in more years\u0026rsquo; of information. If we just focus on the length of record, we are looking for thin annual layers, which sends us to the Antarctic Plateau, where only a little snow (equivalent of about 5 cm of ice) falls each year.\nThe next consideration is where to go relative to ice flow; we want a continuous record, layered up like a cake. Oldest ice should be at the bottom, youngest at the top, and no jumps or reversals in between. Besides this nice layering, we want to know where the ice came from. Perhaps surprisingly, there can be significant disturbances, even large overturned folds, in the ice, which would prevent easy dating of the ice core and thus hinder its use as a climate record. Ultimately, deep ice cores are used to learn about past climate, and as you can imagine it is much less useful to know things like temperature without knowing where that temperature was measured. So, we often drill long climate records at or near ridges and domes, areas where the ice moves little side-to-side. Much of the Antarctic interior fits this bill, since there are several large domes and connecting ridges where ice is flowing slowly.\n   Ice velocities in Antarctica, from Rignot et al., 2011 via NASA\u0026#39;s Earth Observatory. Tan colors indicate slow ice, generally desirable for ice cores.\n   Another major consideration for ice coring is whether the ice is melting at the bed. Thick ice generally insulates the deep ice, so even in locations where the surface temperatures average around -55 C, the ice 3 km down at the bed can be melting. Basal melt is clearly not desirable for old ice; if old ice is at the bottom, then melt removes that exact record. So, counter-intuitively, given the same surface temperature and snow accumulation, the thickest locations are not expected to hold the oldest ice. We still want the ice to be pretty thick, so that it preserves enough of old ice for us to measure, but we want it to be thin enough not to melt at the bed. In the region of Dome C, models indicate that the freeze/melt transition should happen around an ice thickness of 2700-2800 m, so we want some ice that is safely thinner than that. Luckily, this exists at Little Dome C, and thus the target of drilling there.\nHowever, since it is off the true dome, and since the dome could have moved in the past, there is some consideration of whether the stratigraphy (layering of the ice) is clean. Previous ice-penetrating radars used in the area did not see layers in the ice near the bed. It is not fully known whether these radars saw nothing because there was nothing to see (for example the ice has flowed too much and has erased all layering) or whether they simply did not have sufficient sensitivity to see the weak, closely spaced reflections coming from those depths. With our brand new instrumentation, moving relatively slowly behind a snowcat and thus allowing greater data volume per distance, we should be able to see anything that is there. Hopefully, armed with new knowledge of the stratigraphy, the committee in charge of the new ice core can confidently select a spot where there will be really old ice.\n   Radargram from near Dome C acquired by the University of Kansas MCoRDS instrument on NASA\u0026#39;s Operation Ice Bridge. Note nice layering at shallow depths compared to the white area above the strongest dark reflection, which comes from the bedrock.\n   Preparations I\u0026rsquo;ve spent much of the fall preparing for this upcoming season. I spent two weeks in Tuscaloosa, AL, to get familiar with the new hardware and start to understand the unique processing considerations. I also spent a week in Bremerhaven, visiting the Alfred Wegner Institute and making sure that we are set up to quickly process the results in the field. It is exciting to get to travel and work with collaborators, but it is also nice to now be back enjoying Autumn in Copenhagen.\n   Lots of smc cables with the new Alabama radar.\n      A nice evening in the port of Bremerhaven.

The idea is to do some modeling that takes advantage of/helps interpret the new EastGRIP ice core. NEGIS is a huge system, and a lot of research and modeling has already been done on it, so my goal is to really leverage new, unique information that we can get from having an ice core in the middle of the ice stream. Because the ice core contains records extending back thousands of years, far longer than more direct records of ice flow, so it could give us unique information about the long-term ice flow. The idea that I have started to run with is to use the crystal fabric of the core as a tracer of past flow. For a primer on crystal fabric, take a look at the work I have doing to use fabric as a tracer of past flow.\nPast work on NEGIS When I was still at the University of Washington, I did some work with then-postdoc Nick Holschuh to understand the relationship between radar data collected on NEGIS and the small-scale flow regime. I ran a number of model simulations, which Nick used to aid in interpretation of the radar data and to determine how well the various simulations matched reality. The work suggests that the isochrones do not match the current flow field, but rather imply some transient changes to the ice stream. While Nick was able to obtain some nice results, they give a tantalizing suggestion of instability without allowing us to quantify it or say much about the cause. Consequently, I was extremely excited to get to come to Copenhagen to work on this system as new data are collected.\nAnisotropic modeling For my current work, I\u0026rsquo;m modeling along flowlines that lead to near the EastGRIP core site. By modeling the development of ice-crystal fabric along multiple flowlines, I can explore a range of possible flow histories (hypothetical ways in which the ice stream might have differed in the past). If we could then associate one these flow histories with what is measured in the ice core, we might then be able to say something about ice flow in the past.\n   Modeling along some hypothetical flowlines. The pearls indicate how travel times in thousands of years, at present day speeds, to the 0 mark.\n   Right now, this work is in its preliminary stages. I have a working model, which took significant time due to all the processes that must be included. One of the many challenges is that many effects must be included; for example, temperature affects how easily ice deforms (see figure below), so we may get a very different fabric if we don\u0026rsquo;t account for the large change in temperature in Greenland since the last ice age. I\u0026rsquo;ve worked out these kinks, and am preparing to run model simulations that can more accurately represent fabric formation on these flowlines and thus be compared with ice-core data.\n   Effect of temperature on a flow line\n   The preliminary results were been encouraging, but the complexity of the different effects led me to take a significant step back and think about the essential aspects of fabric in an ice stream. This led a full project just understanding these effects in the abstract, which is described here.\n","date":1564617600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1564617600,"objectID":"e6b81970a64cd002c0ffa68baec1a1da","permalink":"https://dlilien.github.io/project/negis_proj/","publishdate":"2019-08-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/negis_proj/","section":"project","summary":"Modeling ice fabric to understand the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream\n","tags":["project","greenland","anisotropy"],"title":"Flow history of NEGIS","type":"project"},{"authors":["Joshua Driscol","David A.

This complicates intercomparison of radiometric information between radar systems or even between different datasets collected using the same radar system processed by different operators.  An enormous amount of new radar data is being collected, so now more than ever it is important to have dependable, fast, and compatible processing flows for these data. Here, we present ImpDAR, a cross-platform, open-source impulse radar processor and interpreter written in Python. ImpDAR is designed to be a universal processor that is capable of reading data from the common commercial ground-penetrating radars (i.e. GSSI, PulseEkko, and MALÅ) as well as from some of the custom-built high-frequency systems. The core processing algorithms are based on the St. Olaf radar processor, which required a Matlab license and contained deprecated, legacy code. Other previously available tools also have significant drawbacks: commercial options are expensive, brand-specific, platform-specific, have limited capabilities, and some lack batch processing utilities. The processing flow included in ImpDAR is designed to be versatile, permitting the user to choose between multiple filters, geometric corrections, migration routines, and display options. It performs several critical, customizable processing steps, such as bandpass and horizontal filtering, time correction for antenna spacing, trace geolocation, migration, and elevation correction, among others. After processing data, ImpDAR’s interpreter makes it easy to plot the data and to digitize internal reflecting horizons. There are several additional plotting functionalities to visualize geometry, frequency content, and power of reflected waveforms. As an initial test of ImpDAR, we present interpreted profiles from 500-MHz snow radar used at South Cascade Glacier, Washington state and 3-MHz radar deployed at the South Pole subglacial lake. We hope that ImpDAR can become a common resource for impulse radar processing and interpretation in the glaciological community, and therefore request community input to improve this new tool.","tags":[],"title":"Poster: ImpDAR: an open-source impulse radar processor in Python","type":"talk"},{"authors":["Nicholas Holschuh","David A.

Some shear margins are fixed by subglacial topography, but others are thought to be self‐organizing, evolving by thermal feedbacks to ice viscosity and basal drag which govern the stress balance of ice sheets. Resistive stresses (and properties governing shear‐margin formation) manifest non‐uniquely at the surface, motivating the use of subsurface observations to constrain ice sheet models. In this study, we use ice‐penetrating radar data to evaluate three 3D thermomechanical models of the Northeast Greenland Ice Stream (NEGIS), focusing on model reproductions of ice temperature (a primary control on viscosity) and subsurface velocity. Data/model agreement indicates elevated temperatures in the NEGIS margins, with depth‐averaged temperatures between 2°C and 6°C warmer in the southeast margin compared to ice in streaming flow, driven by vertical heat transport rather than shear heating.

We conducted a suite of numerical model simulations of these glaciers and compared the results to observations to determine the processes controlling their recent evolution. The model simulations indicate that the state of these glaciers in the 1990s was not inherently unstable, i.e. that small perturbations to the grounding line would not necessarily have caused the large retreat that has been observed. Instead, sustained, elevated melt at the grounding line was needed to cause the observed retreat. Weakening of the margins of Crosson Ice Shelf may have hastened the onset of grounding-line retreat but is unlikely to have initiated these rapid changes without an accompanying increase in melt. In the simulations that most closely match the observed thinning, speedup, and retreat, modeled grounding-line retreat and ice loss continue unabated throughout the 21st century, and subsequent retreat along Smith Glacier’s trough appears likely. Given the rapid progression of grounding-line retreat in the model simulations, thinning associated with the retreat of Smith Glacier may reach the ice divide and undermine a portion of the Thwaites catchment as quickly as changes initiated at the Thwaites terminus.

Like last year, this was a very quick season with only about two weeks at the Pole. As in previous years, the field season was timed to span the solstice so as to get the warmest weather at the South Pole (~-10 F this year). We left for New Zealand week after Thanksgiving, and after getting our cold weather gear we started trying to fly to Antarctica on December 13th. At first, we were trying to fly on a \u0026ldquo;Kiwi Herc\u0026rdquo;, a C-130 belonging to the Royal New Zealand Air Force that has wheels and no skis. On the first day, we flew 5 hours before turning around due to changing weather in McMurdo and flying the 5 hours back to Christchurch; these turnaround flights are not altogether uncommon and are called \u0026ldquo;boomerangs\u0026rdquo;. The next day we got on the plane had not even started taxiing when they decided the weather was too bad and the flight was cancelled. The next day we boomeranged once again, arriving back in Christchurch at about midnight after over ten hours in the air. At that point the Kiwi Herc surrendered to the elements and went back to its sunny home. We had a day off from flying, which was a relief, then attempted the Southern Ocean crossing once more on an American LC-130 (the L means it is ski equipped and consequently has much greater flexibility in landing in Antarctica). After nervously counting down the time/guessing when we reached the point of safe return, after which we would no longer have fuel to return to New Zealand and knew we would make it to McMurdo, hope gradually started to build. Soon, we were pretty thrilled to see the Transantarctic mountains appearing out of the few windows.\n             Getting to Antarctica is always exciting, but the two boomerangs made the arrival quite a relief. The view from the Willy Field skiway is truly stunning; on a clear day you can see the volcanoes on Ross Island, multiple islands sticking up from the McMurdo ice shelf, and number of ranges in the Transantarctic mountains. The views started as soon as the back of the plane opened for cargo unloading, with Mt. Erebus nicely framed out the cargo door. The volcano was topped with a very flat lenticular cloud that fully encircled the summit, almost looking like a flying saucer. Mt. Rainier often gets lenticulars as well, so the sight of a one above a volcano is not exactly foreign, but the scale of Mt. Erebus rising up 12,000 ft from sea level makes any view of it impressive. Once out of the plane, I spent the ride in to town with my face plastered to the window staring at the mountains and wishing there were penguins around.\n    So that crews have some time off, flights start to get sparse between Christmas and New Years. We knew we needed to be efficient to make it to Pole and avoid risking a long delay in McMurdo over the holidays. Luckily, we quickly made it through the required trainings in McMurdo, and after a few days were ready to head on to the South Pole. That flight went more smoothly, and we made it to the Pole on the 22nd and started to acclimatize.\nThe first order of business was to remove Max\u0026rsquo;s firn compaction instruments that had spent two winters near the Pole. Firn is nominally the transition stage between snow and ice, that is to say it is just old snow that has not yet had enough other snow piled on top of it to be compressed into ice. The firn instruments all sat atop boreholes measuring the distance from themselves to the bottom of the hole. As the snow settled/the firn compacted, this distance got shorter. By installing these instruments in holes of varying depths, the compaction rate can be determined at various depths in the firn column. Our only way to know if this worked was to go out to the site 50 km from the South Pole and download the data. Max had pulled data off of the instruments last year, so we knew that they had lasted one winter without hiccup, so we were reasonably sure that they would have worked again, but we were still anxious to get out there and be sure that everything was a success. Because they had been in place for two years, there was a lot of snow on top of the instruments; normally there is about 20 cm of snow accumulation (~8 in) near the South Pole, but last year was pretty snowy and there was about 60 cm of snow accumulation (~2 ft). Combined with the snow from the year before, this put the instruments about 3 ft down.\nAfter we drove the two hours out to the site, Max quickly dug out the controller for all the measurements and downloaded the data (Hurray! everything again looked good), and then we were free to start removing the twelve compaction instruments. However, we also had to remove the solar panels and wind turbine that had provided power to these instruments through the prior two winters, and the anchors which kept the power system from blowing over, all of which had been buried ~3 ft down two years before. With all the new snow, those anchors and the bases of the poles holding the power equipment was now around 6 ft deep. Digging these instruments out was exhausting work. Though we had hoped to get them all out in a day, it quickly became apparent that a second day would be needed. After exposing 2/3 of the instruments and extracting enough equipment to fill our sleds for the drive back, we called it a day. We took a one day break to do some GPS surveying and give our backs a rest, then went and finished digging out the equipment.\n                                 The rest of out time at the South Pole was uneventful. As in previous years, we snowmobiled around measuring how much our stakes had moved and then pulling them out. At this point we already had a solid map of ice flow in the area, so the success of our previous measurements meant that most of these additional data really just reduced our already low errors. We also did a bit of ice-penetrating radar work downstream of the Pole and across the flowline 37.5 km upstream. As in previous years I was operating a 200 MHz (VHF) radar, which could see layers in the top 100 m of ice, while Twit dragged his deep (HF; 7 MHz) radar to find the ice thickness and look at deeper layers. As always, the complexity and custom-built nature of the deep radar caused a bit of extra hassle, but Twit was able to get everything working and we collected all the data we had hoped for. In what felt like no time, we were due to head back north. We had some more good flight luck and caught a plane to McMurdo on our first shot.\n    The most exciting part of getting back to McMurdo was the hope of seeing penguins. Penguins only show up near town when there is access to the ocean, and in the time that we had been at the pole a lot more cracks had opened in the sea ice. Our cargo had not made it on our flight with us, so there was little to do during our time in McMurdo, and looking for penguins was my main priority. This quickly paid off with a group of Adelies way out on the sea ice, far enough that a spotting scope was really needed to see them. Adelies were exciting, but I had seen some last year and I was really keen to see an emperor. Max and I decided to walk out to Hut Point, where Robert F. Scott\u0026rsquo;s Discovery Hut still sits nearly undisturbed, and peak around the corner for any penguins. As soon as we passed the hut a big black spot was visible out on the ice, and from the size we knew right away that it was an emperor. Over the next hour we watched it waddle, then increasingly belly slide, along the sea ice. It was making an occasional squawk, which was rather loud even hundreds of yards away. After it had passed us and was sliding away, we walked back to town and watched it through a spotting scope. I\u0026rsquo;m not sure what makes penguins quite so fascinating, other than how foreign they seem, but had it been closer I could have happily spent another few hours watching this one waddle along.\n             We had made it back to McMurdo in time for Max to attempt to defend his title at the McMurdo Marathon. People pay exorbitant sums to run other races in Antarctica, so I had been feeling like it would be a shame to miss this marathon. My one previous marathon had left me somewhat incapacitated for months, so I decided to run the half. Max had come prepared with sheet metal screws for traction, so we got our shoes ready on Saturday and on Sunday morning headed on Ivan the Terrabus to get to the start of the race at the edge of the ice shelf. The half marathon was an out-and-back on the road to the Phoenix runway, while the marathon did that twice. It was a beautiful day, and on the way out I was only running in a shirt and tights; I needed a windbreaker on the way back but even that wasn\u0026rsquo;t bad. There was an aid station at 3.5 miles and at the turnaround; aid was somewhat nontraditional, and as much as I liked the idea I found it a bit early for burgers and beer. I met my goal of finishing in under two hours, though as a result of the soft surface my legs felt more tired than I thought they should. The screws had worked great though, and I did not slip much nor did I have a screw in the sole of my foot. Max led the whole race, but in the last 100 m a Kiwi who had drafted off him for 25 miles sprinted ahead. Alas. On the bright side, we got and email from Twit\u0026rsquo;s brother that Max had made the national news in New Zealand, though only the crazy shirtless skier made it on their Instagram.\n                         After a one-day delay before another scenic flight on an LC-130, we were on to the long series of commercial flights home.\n             ","date":1548704020,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1548704020,"objectID":"2674fadead91fd2f62672f0f66193009","permalink":"https://dlilien.github.io/post/sp_s3/","publishdate":"2019-01-28T11:33:40-08:00","relpermalink":"/post/sp_s3/","section":"post","summary":"In December, I headed to the South Pole for a third field season, wrapping our survey of regional ice flow.

Here, I synthesize the patterns of thickness, velocity, and terminus-position change over Storstrømmen during the satellite record, showing that there is a reservoir of ice accumulating at the termination of fast flow; this ice reservoir could provide the ice needed for a future surge. While this thickening has been previously noted, the observations have not been analyzed with respect to Storstrømmen’s surge mechanics. I combine these observations with a numerical ice-flow model that is used to obtain basal shear stress and temperature fields; these fields are found over the entire ice stream, and here I will present inferred values near EastGRIP as well as on Storstrømmen. I use the observations and inferred shear stress to apply an analytical model of ice-stream stability over till beds (Tulaczyk et al., 2000), showing that Storstrømmen’s present state aligns with an unstable equilibrium posited by that model and arguing that slight changes in thermal regime could thus explain surge behavior.","tags":["greenland","NEGIS","Storstrømmen"],"title":"Modeled temperature and basal shear stress of NEGIS and implications for surge mechanics of Storstrømmen","type":"talk"},{"authors":["David A.

When ice speeds are modeled as increasing by 15% since 10 ka, the upstream accumulation explains 77% of the variance in the SPICEcore‐derived accumulation (versus 22% without speedup). This result demonstrates that the ice‐flow direction and spatial pattern of accumulation were stable throughout the Holocene.

We used remotely sensed measurements of velocity and ice geometry to investigate the processes controlling their changes in speed and grounding-line position over the past 20 years. We combined these observations with inverse modeling of the viscosity of the ice shelves to understand how weakening of the shelves affected this speedup. These ice shelves have lost mass continuously since the 1990s, and we find that this loss results from increasing melt beneath both shelves and the increasing speed of Crosson. High melt rates persisted over the period covered by our observations (1996–2014), with the highest rates beneath areas that ungrounded during this time. Grounding-line flux exceeded basin-wide accumulation by about a factor of 2 throughout the study period, consistent with earlier studies, resulting in significant loss of grounded as well as floating ice. The near doubling of Crosson's speed in some areas during this time is likely the result of weakening of its margins and retreat of its grounding line. This speedup contrasts with Dotson, which has maintained its speed despite increasingly high melt rates near its grounding line, likely a result of the sustained competency of the shelf. Our results indicate that changes to melt rates began before 1996 and suggest that observed increases in melt in the 2000s compounded an ongoing retreat of this system. Advection of a channel along Dotson, as well as the grounding-line position of Kohler Glacier, suggests that Dotson experienced a change in flow around the 1970s, which may be the initial cause of its continuing retreat.","tags":null,"title":"Changes in flow of Crosson and Dotson ice shelves, West Antarctica, in response to elevated melt","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                             I\u0026rsquo;m freshly back from another field season in Antarctica.

We were riding the same snow machines as last year, though Twit\u0026rsquo;s had a great custom shifter knob added. After our heavy use last year, the belt on that machine had to be replaced, and the tight, new belt prevented the Skidoo from starting in gear. Instead the season was spent with something resembling a manual transmission with no clutch, which worked great!\n    After a few days of surveying we brought the Conestoga (a \u0026ldquo;hard-sided structure\u0026rdquo;) to go and help put in a small camp at our field site from last year. This site, 50 km upstream of South Pole along the flowline, had all the instruments that Max had overwintered and an open borehole for the other David to use to log temperature and density. We were able to get all our equipment out there with just one trip on skidoos, so we loaded up everything onto large sleds and hauled it out the day after Christmas.\n        \nEven though we knew it was going to be as we left it, I was still pretty amazed to see our old campsite from few kilometers off, then come to it and find everything as expected. About 20 cm of snow blanketed the site, but flags, solar panels, and a wind turbine made everything easy to find. Even a little remnant of our discarded-ice-core sculptures remained, though it was wind-eroded.\n    Max left twelve instruments logging compaction of the snow and firn (older snow compacting to ice) over the winter, as well as a string of thermistors down another hole to measure temperature, and we did not know if they had successfully recorded through the six-month night. As it turned out, all the instruments had survived the winter despite -75 C temperatures, and so Max only had to download data, replace one instrument that had failed on installation, and then he was done. David got to logging the borehole straight away since the tools have to move slowly through the hole. In the end the neutron probe was unable to handle the temperatures, same as last year, so he had plenty of time to do the temperature log of the hole.\n        \nSkidoo camping is not quite as luxurious as Challenger camping, since you have to do things like wait until you get there to set up your cook tent, but it was still quite comfortable. My best night\u0026rsquo;s sleep of the whole season was my one night at camp. I think this is a result of the relative humidity; the station is filled with air that was formerly really cold then heated, and so has very little moisture. On the other hand, air at that lower temperature can be close to saturation (it was about 75% relative humidity a lot of the time), so in a tent it does not feel as dry.\n        \nTwit and I headed back to the Pole after just one night, and did a couple additional radar profiles to complement those we took the previous year. We took radar profiles for two days, it was back to the GPS survey. Max and David came back the day after we did, and while David logged the temperature in the SPICEcore hole, the other three of us traded off doing GPS. We managed to resurvey almost all of our stake network before running out of time.\n        \nWe made it back to McMurdo with only a short delay, and were sent off by an incredible halo. We ended up waiting for planes in McMurdo for over a week, during which time Max won the McMurdo marathon. During the delay I saw my first penguins, and was able to work on my computer from the station. After a week I was ready to be home though, and after a brief layover in summery Christchurch came right back to Seattle.\n            \n","date":1516183200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1516183200,"objectID":"6605b05b98100a77d2637d33798baffa","permalink":"https://dlilien.github.io/post/sp_s2/","publishdate":"2018-01-17T10:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/sp_s2/","section":"post","summary":"I\u0026rsquo;m freshly back from another field season in Antarctica.

After some work over the summer, it was great to see a lot of our results coming together into a cohesive story. The most exciting result so far is that the shallow radar data, in conjunction with layers dated in SPICEcore, show that the current pattern of accumulation explains ~60% of the variance in layer thickness in SPICEcore. This result seems to suggest stable flow upstream of the South Pole for the past several thousand years! Here\u0026rsquo;s a short bit on the work I\u0026rsquo;ve helped with:\nLast field season we resurveyed GPS stakes that Twit Conway and Michelle had put out the year before. This allowed us to determine the flowline of ice into SPICEcore, and set up our camp on this flowline. We then drove a lot of radar, both shallow (200mhz antenna, to ~100m depth) and deep (to the bed).\nThis summer, I went through and traced layers using the GSSI Radan software. These layers are reflections off of some kind of contrast in the ice; they could come from density variations or from other conductivity variations, e.g. chemical composition changes or an ash layer. I was able to follow 13 of these layers for a full 100km upstream along the flowline.\n   Tracing layers from SPICEcore to 100km upstream\n   Looking just the variations in the first layer in map view, we can see that there is significant variation, likely reflecting variable snowfall or perhaps some redistribution of snow from wind. T.J. Fudge was then able to correlate some of these layers with conductivity variations measured directly in SPICEcore and a core we drilled at the camp 50km upstream. In conjunction with the velocities we measured, we can determine where the snow at different depths in the core fell, assuming no change in flow patterns. We can then determine if the observed variation in layer thickness correlates to the current patterns in accumulation, found using the shallow radar.

However, the type of retreat that we think Antarctic glaciers are committed to takes place over centuries to millenia. Insight into past changes to glaciers over those timescales could give us valuable information on how such retreats take place. In particular, changes to the ice sheets at present are mostly coastal, yet we expect them to migrate inland, and thus information about inland migration of past marginal changes could be particularly valuable. However, there is little direct evidence that we would expect to be preserved from past changes. One potential place where such information might be preserved, though, is in the orientation of crystals in the ice.\nCrystal fabric Glacier ice is composed of small grains that grow in size with depth, starting at the millimeter scale at the surface and growing to centimeters or more deep in the ice sheet. At the surface, these crystals are randomly oriented, because snow falls in random orientations. Deeper in a glacier, deformation causes these crystals to tend to align in preferred direction, which has some interesting effects.\nIt is easiest to start by thinking of an individual ice crystal. Each ice crystal has its water molecules bonded in a hexagonal crystal lattice\u0026ndash;this lattice is quasi-rotationally symmetric in its hexagonal plane (think of a snow flake\u0026ndash;if you rotate it by 60 degrees it looks the same). However, the direction perpendicular to this hexagonal plane does not match this symmetry, and we term this direction the c-axis. We can then describe an individual crystal based on its c-axis orientation. This orientation is a result of the flow history of that crystal\u0026ndash;how it pointed when it fell as snow, how it was squashed, stretched, and rotated with ice flow. This ice crystal fabric affects deformation by making it easier in some directions (think of a deck of cards\u0026ndash;two directions of deforming the deck are easy, one is hard).\nThinking about what happens to an individual crystal is well and good, but if we want to understand how a whole glacier moves we are thinking about an enormous number of crystals, far too many for us to keep track of individually. Instead, we think of a \u0026ldquo;crystal fabric\u0026rdquo;, some kind of aggregate of grains that we may be able to describe in relatively simple mathematical terms. Isotropic (randomly oriented), girdle (forming a circle) and single maximum (pointing mainly in one direction) are probably the most common fabric types in ice. However, even girdles and single maxima can come in different strengths and orientations, and so can hold detailed information about deformation history.\nIce divides (ice flows vertically and in one horizontal dimension away from a ridge), or domes (ice flows radially outward from the dome center), are the simplest to think about since the flow fields in these areas are relatively tame. I\u0026rsquo;ll focus on divides. At divides, the surface has no slope, so there is no shear stress but only downard stress due to gravity, extensional stress away from the divide, and some containing force along the divide. At the divide, the crystal fabric gradually transitions from isotropic (randomly oriented) at the surface to a girdle, or circle in the plane of the divide, due to the extensional stresses. At depth, the ice reaches something of single maximum with crystals pointing upwards, where the vertical stresses dominate. This type of fabric has been seen in ice cores, and models can do a reasonable job reproducing it (see figure below). Just off the divide, we get complex effects as ice is moved around and stress states become more complex. This is seen, for example, in the angle of the fabric which tends to point leftward at certain depths in the right panel of the figure, or in the complex pattern of the shear strain in the left panel. Fabrics are not entirely intuitive, and assessing what fabrics are likely to result from complex deformation regimes is perhaps best done with an ice-flow model.\n   Anisotropic modeling at an ice divide.\n   So how can all this information be used to infer past ice flow? It takes a relatively long time to reorient the ice crystals (thousands of years or more), so if modern ice-crystal fabric does not match modern ice flow, we may have evidence of past changes. Moreover, if we can use an ice-flow model to match different changes to flow with different fabrics, we may be able to identify what changes could cause such a mismatch between fabric and flow. I have been working to model how changes to ice streams will be manifest in the crystal fabric, and thus what we might look for in terms of inferring past changes.\nModeling In an ice flow model, we seek to approximate how fabric evolves in response to the deformation of ice, and how it affects the deformation of the glacier. Modeling ice-crystal fabric is a fairly difficult exercise: the fabric evolves in multiple dimensions, it get moves around by ice flow, and the description we use is continuous despite the fabric itself being discrete. To take out some of the complexity, I\u0026rsquo;m modeling along flowtubes rather than fully in three dimensions. The model is implemented in Elmer/Ice, an open-source software package that is one of the only codes capable of handling the coupled evolution of ice flow and fabric. Using the model, we can get a sense of what fabrics result from ice streams, shown here for a few different ways of having the ice converge together to form a stream.\n   Anisotropic modeling of ice streams. Details are not critical here, but these fabrics are readily distinguished from non-streaming flow.\n   Skipping over the details of all the simulations I have run, it is important to ask whether we could observe these differences. Ice cores allow quite detailed measurement of fabric, so it is almost given that they could resolve these fabrics. However, it would be particularly exciting if we could observe the fabrics without drilling. One potential tool for this is pRES or ApRES, a type of phase sensitive radar. By rotating the radar around, we can identify some integrated information about the fabric. I have used the output of the ice-flow model to generate synthetic radargrams, which tell us what to expect when observing such fabrics with pRES in the field. As seen in the figure below, these are quite complicated, but easily distinguished from pure internal deformation (on the left). This is quite encouraging, and suggest that it should be possible to identify changes to past ice-stream flow by observing the fabric from the surface.\n   Synthetic radargrams for pRES on hypothetical ice streams.\n   ","date":1486684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486684800,"objectID":"bc0b351e45979f3362755c5b6e6edc5d","permalink":"https://dlilien.github.io/project/fabric/","publishdate":"2017-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/fabric/","section":"project","summary":"Using crystal fabric to infer past flow\n","tags":["project","anisotropy"],"title":"Ice-crystal fabric","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                                C-17\n      C-17\n      Seals\n      Buckling\n      Boarding the Basler\n      Heated Tent\n      Concordia\n      Concordia\n      To camp\n      Generator\n      Pisten Bully\n      Radar Setup\n      Homeward\n      Me\n      Enigma\n      Adelies\n    ","date":1486684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486684800,"objectID":"fa3bbf897646977d820210bf5b5158ec","permalink":"https://dlilien.github.io/photos/ldc/","publishdate":"2017-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/photos/ldc/","section":"photos","summary":" \n","tags":["photos","fieldwork"],"title":"Little Dome C","type":"photos"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                             Crosson and Dotson are two of the most rapidly changing ice shelves in West Antarctica. Ice shelves are floating extensions of land-based glaciers, and are important for the flow of those glaciers upstream because they can provide resistive stresses at the grounding zone (the area where the ice goes afloat). Because of the cold air temperature there is little surface melt in Antarctica, so the vast majority of ice reaches the ocean and either melts at the underside of ice shelves or calves off as icebergs. Ice shelves are therefore critical as both a stabilizing force and as the conduit for the reservoir of ice in Antarctica to reach the ocean.\n   Location of Crosson and Dotson in West Antarctica\n   The first chapter of my thesis investigated the stability of Crosson and Dotson ice shelves during the satellite record (1996-2015). Previous work has shown a 35 km retreat of the grounding line (Figure 2), the largest known present-day grounding-line retreat. These two ice shelves move at very different speeds; Crosson is fast (up to ~1500 m/yr) while Dotson is slow (around 300 m/yr). Additionally, Crosson sped up through the satellite record while Dotson did not. I\u0026rsquo;m interested in the reasons behind the different speed changes and grounding-line position changes that have been observed. This mostly observational work was published in The Cryosphere in 2018.\n   Ice speeds in 2010 (from Ian Joughin) and grounding line positions (from Scheuchl et. al. 2016)\n   A central conclusion of the work is that although Dotson is sluggish, high melt rates near its grounding line imply that it has been out of balance since at least 1996. Using relict surface features of the shelf, we argue that this imbalance began much earlier, likely prior to to 1974.\nThe second portion of this project used a numerical model to try to understand how much melt, or how much grounding-line retreat or weakening of the ice shelves, was required to cause the observed changes. This work is currently in review at The Cryosphere Discussions. I ran a suite of numerical model simulations, initialized to match the state of these glaciers in 1996, then simulated their evolution during the last 20 years using various melt forcings. The model results indicate that high melt rates were needed to cause the retreat, and that rates needed to be strong near the grounding line for significant retreat to ensue. This conclusion remained regardless of whether the ice shelves weakened; weak shelves hastened retreat, but appeared unable to precipitate it.\n   Simulations of grounding-line retreat during the time period with observations\n   After comparing the results of these model simulations to satellite data, I ran a subset of the simulations forward in time to 2100. While these simulations are not predictions in the sense that the ocean forcing is not tied directly to likely scenarios, they are realistic estimates of likely retreat in that they maintain reasonable melt rates (around modern) for the duration of the simulations. The simulations that match the present-day retreat continue to retreat into the future, and suggest that a significant portion of the ice in these catchments will be lost by 2100. Such extensive retreat has the potential to hasten the destabilization of Thwaites glacier, Smith\u0026rsquo;s larger neighbor.\n   Long-term simulations of retreat of these glaciers\n   ","date":1486684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486684800,"objectID":"a02a64d76bd700aa02f569851a3916fc","permalink":"https://dlilien.github.io/project/cd_proj/","publishdate":"2017-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/cd_proj/","section":"project","summary":"Understanding the retreat of Amundsen Sea ice shelves/streams\n","tags":["project","ice shelves","antarctic"],"title":"Retreat of Smith Glacier, Antarctica","type":"project"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                                Erebus\n      Flying to Pole\n      Trans-Antarctic Mountains\n      GPS for surveying\n      Surveying\n      Equipment\n      Core Boxes\n      Batteries\n      Work Tent\n      Drilling\n      Drilling\n      Labeling Core\n      \u0026#34;Hand\u0026#34; drilling\n      Empty Hole\n      Measuring Temperature\n      Core art\n      Transporting Core\n      Clean Measurements\n      Snowpit\n      Measuring Compaction\n      Measuring Compaction\n      Measuring Ice Depth\n      Halo\n      Bollard\n      Boarding the LC-130\n      Drygalski ice tongu\n      Unloading the LC-130\n      Out at the skiway\n      Melt ponds\n      Beardmore?\n      Piedmont glaciers\n      Some rocks\n      Skidoos\n      Navigation\n      Digging\n      Digging\n      Digging\n      Digging\n      NZ Christmas Cake\n      Holes\n      A borehole\n      Packing up\n      Packing up\n      Ozone balloon\n      Ozone balloon\n      Twit\u0026#39;s radar\n      Transantarctic mountains\n      Emperor Penguin\n      Emperor Penguin\n      Emperor Penguin\n      Mt.

An overall summary of the project is on Michelle\u0026rsquo;s website, so here I\u0026rsquo;ll just summarize the portions with which I\u0026rsquo;m involved.\nThe South Pole Ice Core (SPICEcore) was drilled during 2014-2016 by scientists working around the US, recovering ice from about 1 km from the geographic south pole. There are a lot of benefits to drilling at this site, but one complication is that South Pole is not on an ice divide. The ice at South Pole moves about 10 m/yr; one fun consequence is that South Pole Station and surrounding surface is moving relative to the Pole, so each year on New Years the marker for the Pole gets replaced by a new one, made by the overwintering crew, placed at the new location of the Pole.\n    The motion of the ice means that the composition of gas, impurities, and water isotopes in SPICEcore is affected by the composition of those components upstream at the time the ice originated as snow. This is both a blessing and a curse; it creates ambiguity in the cause of variations recorded in the core, since some changes in isotopes or temperature may be caused by spatial rather than temporal variation. However, an ice core drilled in stationary ice contains information about only one point in horizontal space, whereas SPICEcore recors information along a line. My involvement is mostly driving a snowmachine around.\n   The flowline into SPICEcore\n   The central aim of this project is to characterize ice flow upstream of the site of SPICEcore in both the vertical and horizontal dimensions. In the vertical, this means understanding firn (old snow) compaction, while in the horizontal this means determining where the ice is coming from and how long it took to get to the core site. I\u0026rsquo;ve mainly been involved with the horizontal portion, though I\u0026rsquo;ve also done two seasons of shallow radar profiling to look at horizontal variability of layers in the firn.\nTo determine the flowline, and how long the ice takes to flow along that flowline, we used a network of GPS stakes. These days, when we want to find out how ice is moving we use satellite observations (InSAR or optical feature tracking), but the orbits of satellites generally do not go over the poles, so we are unable to use satellite velocities in this region. While GPS also uses satellites, the satellites do not need to be directly overhead, and GPS receivers near South Pole can still see at least twelve satellites and thus obtain an accurate position. By putting out stakes and measuring their displacement over the course of 1-2 years using GPS, we figured out the velocity in the region upstream of South Pole (Figure 2). Using this velocity, it is straightforward to determine the flowline into SPICEcore. My role in this GPS work has mainly been a lot of snowmachining out to place and measure the position of these stakes.\n        The flowline into SPICEcore\n  \nMy other main involvement with the project has been with the spatial variation of accumulation (i.e. snowfall). About 20 cm of snow fall each year at South Pole, which compacts into about 9 cm of ice, but the amount of accumulation varies horizontally, probably based on weather patterns and surface topography (imagine snow blowing off hilltops into valleys). In order to figure out how much accumulation takes place at different places upstream of South Pole, we used a ground penetrating radar. This is just a commercial system, usually used by geologists to see through a few meters of soil or rock. However, the frequency travels farther in ice and snow than rock, especially in cold, dry snow, so we can see layers (likely caused by density variations) down to 100 m near South Pole. By dragging this radar around behind a snowmachine, I traced layers to determine how accumulation varies along the lines we profiled (Figure 3).\n        Tracing layers in a profile for 100 km upstream from SPICEcore\n  \nBy comparing the accumulation along the flowline upstream of SPICEcore to the layer thicknesses in SPICEcore, we were able to determine that the flow direction and the pattern of accumulation have been approximately unchanged over the last 10,000 years. During that time, ice flow speeds increased by around 15%. This speedup is not surprising given what we know about the ice thickness history. Ice has gotten thicker in the Antarctic interior since the last glacial because warmer air is able to transport more moisture and thus cause more snow, and ice near the Antarctic margin has thinned due to the warmer temperatures resulting in more melt (mostly from warm water contacting ice shelves). These results were published in Geophysical Research Letters in 2018.\nThe flow of ice upstream also has implications for interpreting the ice core. T.J. Fudge is leading a paper on these effects, and that will be coming out soon (likely 2019).\n","date":1486684800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1486684800,"objectID":"e7b30bdaf56f555856f115f656f9f20b","permalink":"https://dlilien.github.io/project/sp_proj/","publishdate":"2017-02-10T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/project/sp_proj/","section":"project","summary":"Investigating ice flow upstream of South Pole\n","tags":["project","fieldwork","south pole","antarctic"],"title":"South Pole Geophysics","type":"project"},{"authors":["Kristin Poinar","Ian Joughin","David A.

Previous measurements show that a 3.5-km long segment of the aquifer lost a large volume of water (26,000–65,000 m$^2$ in cross section) between spring 2012 and spring 2013, compared to annual meltwater accumulation of 6000–15,000 m$^2$. The water is thought to have entered the crevasses, but whether the water reached the bed or refroze within the ice sheet is unknown. We used a thermo-visco-elastic model for crevasse propagation to calculate the depths and volumes of these water-filled crevasses. We compared our model output to data from the Airborne Topographic Mapper (ATM), which reveals the near-surface geometry of specific crevasses, and WorldView images, which capture the surface expressions of crevasses across our 1.5-km study area. We found a best fit with a shear modulus between 0.2 and 1.5 GPa within our study area. We show that surface meltwater can drive crevasses to the top surface of the firn aquifer (~20 m depth), whereupon it receives water at rates corresponding to the water flux through the aquifer. Our model shows that crevasses receiving firn-aquifer water hydrofracture through to the bed, ~1000 m below, in 10–40 days. Englacial refreezing of firn-aquifer water raises the average local ice temperature by ~4°C over a ten-year period, which enhances deformational ice motion by ~50 m year$^{−1}$, compared to the observed surface velocity of ~200 m year$^{−1}$. The effect of the basal water on the sliding velocity remains unknown. Were the firn aquifer not present to concentrate surface meltwater into crevasses, we find that no surface melt would reach the bed; instead, it would refreeze annually in crevasses at depths ","tags":null,"title":"Drainage of Southeast Greenland Firn Aquifer Water through Crevasses to the Bed","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                                Nisqually Glacier\n      Deming Ice Fall\n      Easton Glacier\n      Coleman Glacier\n      Twin Sisters\n      Twin Sisters\n      Tomyhoi Glacier\n      Goode Glacier\n      Goode Glacier\n      Inspiration Glacier\n      McAllister Glacier\n      Quien Sabe Glacier\n    ","date":1440892800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1440892800,"objectID":"3a7edfb0148541943a361cbdad65462f","permalink":"https://dlilien.github.io/photos/wa_glaciers/","publishdate":"2015-08-30T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/photos/wa_glaciers/","section":"photos","summary":" \n","tags":["photos","rec"],"title":"Around the Cascades","type":"photos"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"                                An esker\n      A pingo\n      A hotspring\n      Lava\n      New Land\n      Berg\n      Camping on a medial morain\n      Donahoe\n      Rock glacier\n      Chamonix\n      Alps Glacier\n      Matterhorn\n      Mitre Peak\n      Matukituki\n      An NZ hut\n      An NZ outhous\n      Mitre Peak\n      Mt.

Surveys across widely divergent butterfly species have identified multiple mechanisms of structural color production; however, little is known about how these colors evolved. Here, we examine how closely related species and populations of Bicyclus butterflies have evolved violet structural color from brown-pigmented ancestors with UV structural color. We used artificial selection on a laboratory model butterfly, B. anynana, to evolve violet scales from UV brown scales and compared the mechanism of violet color production with that of two other Bicyclus species, Bicyclus sambulos and Bicyclus medontias, which have evolved violet/blue scales independently via natural selection. The UV reflectance peak of B. anynana brown scales shifted to violet over six generations of artificial selection (i.e., in less than 1 y) as the result of an increase in the thickness of the lower lamina in ground scales. Similar scale structures and the same mechanism for producing violet/blue structural colors were found in the other Bicyclus species. This work shows that populations harbor large amounts of standing genetic variation that can lead to rapid evolution of scales' structural color via slight modifications to the scales' physical dimensions.","tags":null,"title":"Artificial selection for structural color on butterfly wings and comparison with natural evolution","type":"publication"}]
